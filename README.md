# Sales-Prediction-and-Comparing-Classification-Metrics
This project uses Walmart Historical Sales Data sets and apply various ML models to predict the sales. In this project we are not using any forward or back propogation. We are applying ML models and comparing various metrics of regression models such rmse, r^2 and other metrics.

#Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to explore and apply different Machine Learning techniques to predict sales accurately. We will not be using any forward or backward propagation techniques, as the focus is on applying traditional regression models and evaluating their performance.
